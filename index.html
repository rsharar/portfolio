  <!-- Student description -->
  <p>I am a Content Manager at an educational-technology company called <a href="https://www.activelylearn.com/">Actively Learn</a>. Previously I worked as a high school science teacher (Physics, Chemistry and AP Chemistry in both Richmond, CA and Seattle, WA. In addition, I was the head varsity basketball coach and led the robotics club, which initially sparked my interest in coding and the power of software engineering. In my spare time I enjoy any and all sports, but specifically basketball, as well as any outdoor activity including hiking, skiing and snowboarding.</p>
